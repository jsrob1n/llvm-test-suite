This benchmark has been extensively modified to cope with LNT's infrastructure.

It no longer checks for CPU frequency, nor produces comparable outputs to
previous versions. The main reason to have this benchmark is to check both
performance and correctness of floating point loop reductions during
vectorization, so the heuristics provided is nothing more than just
a floating point hash generated from some of the data to compare for
floating point accuracy.

Also, the timings are being taken on the whole executable (by LNT), so
they're not as accurate as taking the inner loop, since there is considerable
code to prepare the data and to calculate the heuristics.

However, both prepare and heuristics are fp-loop based, so will also
benefit from optimizations in that area, which will affect the final
timing.
